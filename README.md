# Notice

After learning a little bit of Rust and playing around with it and the Iced framework, I've decided it's not worth the effort making this app in Rust. Instead, I'll be remaking it using React since I am much more familiar with that.

# Super Smash Bros Ultimate - Randomizer

Application for generating a list of randomized fighters for SSBU on the Nintendo Switch. Written in Rust using the [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) framework.

## Running the Application

Simply clone this repo and then in the root directory enter the following in a terminal:

```
cargo run
```
